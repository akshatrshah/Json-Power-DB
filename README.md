This the mini project done for Login2Xplore. 
The porject contains basics of Json Power Database(JPDB) and CRUD operations on a JPDB.



What is Json-Power-DB?
JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.



What are the prominent features of Json-Power-DB?
- Proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD operations. Multiple times faster than popular DBMS.
- Serverless support for faster development - A UI developer can develop complete dynamic application.
- DBMS with built in web / application server and embedded caching makes the performance lightning fast.
- Server side Native NoSQL - best query performance.
- In-built support to query on multiple JPDB databases.
- Multi-mode DBMS - Document DB, Key-Value DB, RDBMS support.
- Schema free - easy to develop and maintain.
- Web-services API - Can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.
- Enriched by a pluggable API Framework - A developer can develop a pluggable API and plugin into any of our cloud JPDB instance.
- Standardisation of API development framework makes the development process easy, more readable, and less error prone.
- Multiple security layers.
- Nimble, Simple to use, In Memory, Real-time DBMS.



Benefits of using Json-Power-DB?
- Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
- Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
- It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
- It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
- It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
